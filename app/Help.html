<h3>Cartesian Coordinate System</h3>
The system expects a formula in terms of X, Y, and Z.<br/>
Z is a function of X & Y which both go from -1 to 1'.<br/>

<h3>Spherical Coordinate System</h3>
The system expects a formula in terms of radius, phi, and theta.<br/>
radius is a function of theta (0 to PI) and phi (0 to 2xPI)'.<br/>

<h3>Toroidal Coordinate System</h3>
The system expects a formula in terms of radius, phi, and theta.<br/>
radius is a function of theta (0 to PI) and phi (0 to 2xPI)'.<br/>

<h3>Cylindrical Coordinate System</h3>
The system expects a formula in terms of radius, phi, and Z.<br/>
Z is a function of radius (0 to 1) and phi (0 to 2xPI)'.<br/>

<h3>Cylindrical Coordinate System</h3>
The system is using cartesian coordinates but expecting a parametric equation.<br/>
That means the system expects a formula in terms of x,y,z,u and v.<br/>

<h3>Helper Variables</h3>
You can use any of the following as helper variables:<br/>
xx, yy, zz, rr, phi, pp, qq, r1, r2,r3, point<br/>
