Cartesian Coordinate System
The system expects a formula in terms of X, Y, and Z.
Z is a function of X & Y which both go from -1 to 1'.

Spherical Coordinate System
The system expects a formula in terms of radius, phi, and theta.
radius is a function of theta (0 to PI) and phi (0 to 2xPI)'.

Toroidal Coordinate System
The system expects a formula in terms of radius, phi, and theta.
radius is a function of theta (0 to PI) and phi (0 to 2xPI)'.

Cylindrical Coordinate System
The system expects a formula in terms of radius, phi, and Z.
Z is a function of radius (0 to 1) and phi (0 to 2xPI)'.

Cylindrical Coordinate System
The system is using cartesian coordinates but expecting a parametric equation.
That means The system expects a formula in terms of x,y,z,u and v.

Helper Variables
You can use any of the following as helper variables:
xx, yy, zz, rr, phi, pp, qq, r1, r2,r3, point
